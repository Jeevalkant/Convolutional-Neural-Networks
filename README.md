# Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This repository focuses on implementing and training fully connected neural networks (NN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The assignment is divided into four parts, providing hands-on experience with different datasets and allowing you to practice building, training, and adjusting neural networks.
