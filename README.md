# Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This repository focuses on implementing and training fully connected neural networks (NN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). 
This contains the part building a basic Neural Network followed by how to optimize and improve using various techniques. 

This project was completed as part of the Assignment for CSE 4/574: Introduction to Machine Learning at the University at Buffalo. Credit for the assignment goes to Professor Alina Vereshchaka.

A detailed report of this project has also been submitted for a deeper understanding of the work done in this repository.
